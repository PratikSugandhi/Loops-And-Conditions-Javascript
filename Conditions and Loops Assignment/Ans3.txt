Looping in programming languages is a feature that facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. For example, suppose we want to print “Hello World” 10 times. This can be done in two ways as shown below:

Iterative Method: The iterative method to do this is to write the console.log() statement 5 times.
****
while loop-
syntax-
while (boolean condition) {
    loop statements...
}

**example code
let n=1;
while(n<=5)
{
    console.log("Hello World");      //It will print Hello World 5 times;
    n++;
}

*****
for loop
for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy-to-debug structure of looping. 

syntax-

for (initialization; testing condition; increment/decrement) {
    statement(s)
}

**example code
for(let i=1;i<=5;i++)
{
    console.log("Hello World");      //It will print Hello World 5 times;
}


*****do-while loop

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop with the only difference is that it checks for the condition after executing the statements, and therefore is an example of an Exit Control Loop. 

syntax-
do {
    Statements..
}
while (condition);


***example code

let n=1;
do{
    console.log("Hello World");      //It will print Hello World 5 times;
}while(n<=5);
