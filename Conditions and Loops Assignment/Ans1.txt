Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on conditions. If the condition meets then a particular block of action will be executed otherwise it will execute another block of action that satisfies that particular condition.

There are several methods that can be used to perform Conditional Statements in JavaScript
1.if statement.
2.else if statement.
3. if else ladder statement.
4.switch statement.
5.Ternary statement.

syntax-
if ( condition ) {
    // If the condition is met, 
    //code  will get executed.
}

example code-
let num = 20; 
  
if (num % 2 === 0) { 
    console.log("Given number is even number."); 
} 
  
if (num % 2 !== 0) { 
    console.log("Given number is odd number."); 
};

***example code for if-else statement

let age = 25; 
  
if (age >= 18) { 
    console.log("You are eligible of driving licence") 
} else { 
    console.log("You are not eligible for driving licence") 
};

****example code for switch statement

switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        statement1;
        break;
    case value2:
        statement2;
        break;
    . . .
    case valueN:
        statementN;
        break;
    default:
        statementDefault;
};


**example code for Ternary statement

let age = 21; 
  
const result = 
    (age >= 18) ? "You are eligible to vote."
        : "You are not eligible to vote."; 
  
console.log(result);
